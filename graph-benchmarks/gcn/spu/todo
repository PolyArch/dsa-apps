1. Store in incoming edges format (undirected graph or no?)
2. Declare vertex data data-structure
3. extra storage for new adj matrix or copy from sampling in parallel? probably
   need duplicate copies?
4. datatype of indices? 4 bytes or 8? 4 I guess?
5. how to distribute sampling among threads?
6. decide about the fmap data-structure

uint ka 0 mein bhi panga h
scratch_size=1 MB (10+10 = 20 bits of addr required)
num_threads=1 reading weird things
TODO: is the value read correct?

Comments:
Pull
1. Easier load balancing
2. remote read of 256 elements
3. should I put a flag for for all local?
