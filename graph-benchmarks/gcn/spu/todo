1. Store in incoming edges format (undirected graph or no?)
2. Declare vertex data data-structure
3. extra storage for new adj matrix or copy from sampling in parallel? probably
   need duplicate copies?
4. datatype of indices? 4 bytes or 8? 4 I guess?
5. how to distribute sampling among threads?
6. decide about the fmap data-structure

uint ka 0 mein bhi panga h
scratch_size=1 MB (10+10 = 20 bits of addr required) -- send only offset in the
new one
num_threads=1 reading weird things

PACKETS ISSUED IN SAME CYCLE WILL REACH TOGETHER (SEE HOW TO MODEL NET BW
    PROPERLY)
1. Partitioning
2. MM correctness
3. feat_len=256
4. gcn layers?
5. preload?

Should we do something for access same data multiple times? (but array is
large) -- same stream (in that case, cpu stride would be 0 I guess?)

Oh that cyclic thing...
SS_SCR_PORT_STREAM(scr_addr,stride,acc_size,n_strides, port)

Comments:
Pull
1. Easier load balancing
2. remote read of 256 elements
3. should I put a flag for for all local?
4. vectorize the matrix-multiplication
5. See if any pattern in the destination, sampling should be on OOO and the
   gem5 can read the sampled graph for now? (single layer)


GIVING ERROR FOR HIGHER FEAT LEN (HIGHER NUM_THREADS GIVE ERROR)
acc_ctrl has extra values?
IT DOESN'T WAIT FOR DMA WRITE TO GET OVER...

4. everything from scratch other than graph data-structure? memory bw underutilization (what to do for offset
   array?)


8 cores suddenly giving error again

dma_read of different threads from the same location error? NO SHOULD NOT BE...
indirect scr from different ports error?
